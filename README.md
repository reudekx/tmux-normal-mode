# Tmux normal mode

---

Tmux Normal Mode is essentially just a collection of key bindings that introduce mode switching in tmux, similar to how Vim operates.

Though it is distributed as a TPM plugin, since it's just a bunch of simple key bindings, you don't need to use TPM to install it. Simply copy the settings into your tmux configuration file and feel free to modify them as you wish.

I add new key bindings occasionally whenever I have some spare time.

## Installation

Install using [Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):
```bash
set -g @plugin 'reudekx/tmux-normal-mode'
```
